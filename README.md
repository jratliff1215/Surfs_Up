# Surfs Up
Weather Analysis of Oahu

# Overview of the Weather Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize SQLite and SQLAlchemy to create sql engines on local servers to conduct queries that analyzed key weather trends for a new app for a surf shop. The analysis is to provide weather data to analyze the possible success of a surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. 

# Summary

* The table below shows descriptive statistics of the wether in June and December, respectively. Both months report an average temperature abover 70 degrees, which is warm enough for surfing and ice cream, the two main concerns of of client.

* June data provides more data points to analyze. Altough less than 10% in variance for readily available infrmation, additional information may provide more detail to true weather patterns in December. 

* Even with fewer data points, more than 1,500 data points in each month is likely sufficeint to be significant and provide a complete analysis of the respective months. There is no conern in the data accuracy or completeness. 

# Further Analysis
A study on precipitation is required to ensure the selected months will not be impacted by rain. Based on the average temperatures, neither snow nor hail is likely to impact the success of the surf shop. However, heavy rains during monsoon season or El Nino weather patterns may impact the foot traffic to the shop.
